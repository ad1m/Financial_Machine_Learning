This data is extremly regularized and low frequency. Since this data is so accessible to the marketplace, it is unlikely that there is much value left to be exploited. However, it can be useful in combination with other data types.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Market Data:</b> Data from all trading activity that takes place in an exchange such as price, volatility, dividends, and volume.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Analytics:</b> Data that has already been proccessed in a particular way such as analyst recommendations, credit ratings, earnings expectations, and news sentiment. This is data that is usually purchased from an alternate vendor.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Alternative Data:</b> Primary information that has not made it yet to other sources such as sattelite images, google searches, and twitter posts. This data is usually more unique and harder to process.</li>\n",
